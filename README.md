# Machine-learning

Machine learning algorithm program written in python that determines the passengers of a ship who will survive by learning the data given in the training dataset(test.csv) and predict the values by testing it on the testing dataset (test.csv).
The code utilises 4 learning models logistic regression, stochastic gradient descent, support vector machines and random forest. Based on the scores the one with the highest score's output is written into submission.csv.
