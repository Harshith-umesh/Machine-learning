# Machine-learning

Machine learning algorithm program written in python that determines the passengers of a ship who will survive by learning the data given in the training dataset(test.csv) and predict the values by testing it on the testing dataset (test.csv).
The code utilises 4 learning models logistic regression, stochastic gradient descent, support vector machines and random forest. Based on the scores, the one with the highest score's output is written into submission.csv.
Data cleaning and Data preprocessing operations have been carried out. output,output2,output3 are the graphs generated for data analysis.

use of python3 is recommended for running the code.
